Data Sources and Preparation for Analysis

Data Files Utilized:
- 2001 Data:  2001 Data Education^J Population^J Religion^J Workers.csv
- 2011 Data: 2011 Data Education^J Population^J Religion^J Workers.csv
- 1991 Data:Census 1991(Base sheet).csv(These sheets have data regarding religion and population) 
- Growth and Literacy Rates: 2011 Growth Rate and Literacy Rate, 2001 Growth Rate and Literacy Rate, 1991 Growth Rate and Literacy Rate (datasets related to education level, growth rate, and literacy rate)
 Data Extraction and Filtering Process:
1. Downloading Data:
   - We sourced the Excel files from the official census website, specifically downloading files such as 1991 C09T-0100, 1991-B01T0100, and 1991-C02T-0100.
   
2. Filtering Data in Excel:
   - Using Excel's filter rows option, we filtered the data to focus on state-level information, excluding district-level data.

3. Filtering Data in R:
   - Additional filtering was performed using R to refine the datasets further.

4. Columns of Interest:
   - We maintained columns for the total population and the literacy rate for individuals aged 7 and above.

5. Calculating Literacy Rate:
   - The literacy rate was calculated using the formula:(Total Literates/ Population Age 7 and Above)*100

6. Calculating Growth Rate:
   - The growth rate for 2011 was computed using the formula:((Population of 2011-Population of 2001)/Population of 2001)*100 similar to 1991 and 2001.  A similar method was applied for the years 1991 and 2001.

7. Data Organization:
   - Separate Excel sheets were prepared for each variable, including education level, workers, and religion, to streamline analysis.

8. Continuous Dataset Updates:
   - The datasets were updated continuously as needed to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the analysis.
